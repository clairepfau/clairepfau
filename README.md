# Hi, I'm Claire! 👋

**Community College Student | Python Developer | Musician**

I'm passionate about using code to solve real-world problems, especially when it involves creative hardware solutions and audio technology. Currently seeking internship opportunities where I can combine my love for programming with music/audio tech.

## 🎵 About Me

- 🎸 **Musician**: 4+ years in metalcore/hardcore bands, multi-instrumentalist (guitar, bass, drums, piano, vocals)
- 🎛️ **Audio Producer**: Love creating and producing music, always experimenting with new sounds
- 💻 **Problem Solver**: I enjoy using what I have to create solutions and make life easier
- 🔧 **Hardware Hacker**: Building DIY solutions with cheap hardware to solve expensive problems

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills

**Languages & Tools:**
- Python (primary focus)
- HTML/CSS
- Git/GitHub
- Bash/Linux
- Hardware integration (Raspberry Pi, Arduino-style projects)

**Libraries & Frameworks:**
- librosa (audio processing)
- Various Python data analysis and automation libraries

## 🚀 Current Projects

**🎛️ DIY Quad Cortex**: Converting an old gaming laptop into an all-in-one live guitar processing solution with analog controls, e-ink display, and foot switches - because great tone shouldn't cost $2000.

**🎵 Live Sample Player**: Raspberry Pi + Xbox 360 controller system for triggering band intros and 808 drops during live shows. Built this because we needed it and commercial solutions were overpriced.

**🤖 Smart Meeting Assistant**: Automatic transcription with speaker ID, timestamps, and AI-generated action items for meeting organizers.

**🛒 Food Inventory System**: Receipt scanner that creates a home inventory management system, suggests recipes based on what you have, and reduces food waste.

## 📈 Featured Repositories

- **[BPM Detector](https://github.com/clairepfau/bmp-detector)**: Audio tempo detection using onset analysis and autocorrelation

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

I'm actively seeking **internship or junior developer opportunities**, especially roles that involve:
- Python development
- Audio/music technology
- Creative problem-solving with hardware
- Building tools that make life easier

**Dream companies**: Neural DSP, Kemper, Line-6, Shure, Fender, Ibanez, Avid, Image-Line - or any company where music meets technology!

## 🤘 When I'm Not Coding

- Jamming with my band or writing new music
- Going to a cat cafe
- Producing tracks in my home studio  
- Watching sunsets and spending time in nature
- Discovering new metalcore/hardcore bands (current favorites: Boundaries, Gulch, Knocked Loose, Deftones, weaponX)

*"Using what you have to create solutions and make life easier"* - that's my philosophy in both music and code.
